# Advent of Code
Pure Rust solutions to Advent of Code challenges. I've done the challenge before, but since lost my solutions, so this will be for 2024 onwards. If you're going to reference this code, please add a link to this repo alongside it.

I make no claims about this code's optimality, besides that anything I upload will complete the challenges without brute forcing it*

I also made some nice ASCII art, so please enjoy.

<sub><sup>* Except for where brute force keeps it below 1s on my machine... I couldn't be bothered for day two.</sup></sub>
